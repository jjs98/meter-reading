# Meter Reading

This is a simple project to track the meter readings of a house. You can add readings for electricity, gas and water and see the history of the readings. If you have multiple people living in the house, you can also share the readings with them, so that everyone can see the history of the readings. (For example the electricity readings for the house)

You can also see the usage of the utilities in a graph. This way you can see how much you are using and if you are using more or less than before.

Also you can download the readings in a .xlsx file, so that you can use the data in other applicationso or share them with your landlord.
